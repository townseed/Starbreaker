more choices == better in most cases
-choice to upload an enemy or consume it
-choice to upgrage mech at milestone

health is a bitch
-have an actual health pool (not just 1 hit = 1 heart)
--an actual health pool allows tank builds to exist and feel better
--it also allows more granular adjustment of hp-damage ratios on enemies

design decisions that make this unique
-killed/downed enemies are a resource
-the character evolves within a run
-summons are exclusive to very specific mechs

problems that are introduced by these decisions
-how to prevent players from aquiring too many resourses (eating/uploading all enemies before moving on to the next thing)
--this could slow the pace of the game too much
-each mech needs to have eating and uploading animations
-more evolutions means that each evolution might stick out less/be less recognizable
-building combos for (each?) evolution will be a lot of work, but will also be really cool
-leveling between evolutions can give stats or something? - should there be more levels than mech evolutions?
-should forgoing an evo allow your mech to upgrade itself in some other way? Or should it provide metagame bonuses (extra money in hub or whatever)

difficulty systems - how does the game become more/less difficult
pristige (like ror2) is good, maybe not the best though
modifiers (additional enemy spawns, more damage taken, etc) might be a good addition
more spawns is a good (ish) option, although better enemies/ai is better than more of them (1 smart enemy > 10 dumb ones)

boss battles need to be epic/worth remembering otherwise there's not really a point to having them

metagame center (spacerig/town/ship)
-upgrades?
-cosmetics
-story?
-a better look at the mechs that you can play as
-to start a run you go into the cockpit/tube

the dash key can be used as a seige/unsige key

flying player-controlled characters might not work very well, use walkers with flying compainions if flyers are needed.

level design
-room-based (like soul knight or Hades)
--levels (soul knight) or endless (bubble tanks)
-map based (like hyperlight drifter)
--this might be interisting to make as a side thing or something?
-infinite map based (like vampire survivors)

deaths/game over
-eject the pilot from the mech in the same cockpit/tube that you go into to start the game
-final boss could subvert this expectaion
