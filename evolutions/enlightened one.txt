pacifist monk, evade and strike
evo from: monk-type
weapon: soul - open palm
dash: dash forward leaving a trail of reflections (like moving your mouse cursor fast)
special: stun
game changing: instead of eating/uploading enemies, they are banished in a golden glow and give both xp and healing (although less than if you were to just do one)
